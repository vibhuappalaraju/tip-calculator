Submitted by: Vibhu Appalaraju

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
UI animations (when changing background color)
Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

Added a night theme mode
A split total that splits the bill accoriding to the value of the split slider.

## Notes

I used a decent amount of time trying to figure out how exactly to save UITextfields right before the termination in order to track how long the app was closed for. I could not get it to work but I got to experiment with the app delegate and learned about the lifecycle of the app which I thought was very interesting.
